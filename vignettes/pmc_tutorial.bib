  abstract	= {Biologists employ phylogenetic comparative methods to
		  study adaptive evolution. However, none of the popular
		  methods model selection directly.We explain and develop a
		  method based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, first
		  proposed by Hansen. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models incorporate
		  both selection and drift and are thus qualitatively
		  different from, and more general than, pure drift models
		  based on Brownian motion. Most importantly,OU models
		  possess selective optima that formalize the notion of
		  adaptive zone. In this article, we develop the method for
		  one quantitative character, discuss interpretations of its
		  parameters, and provide code implementing the method. Our
		  approach allows us to translate hy- potheses regarding
		  adaptation in different selective regimes into ex- plicit
		  models, to test the models against data using maximum-like-
		  lihood-based model selection techniques, and to infer
		  details of the evolutionary process. We illustrate the
		  method using two worked examples. Relative to existing
		  approaches, the direct modeling ap- proach we demonstrate
		  allows one to explore more detailed hy- potheses and to
		  utilize more of the information content of com- parative
		  data sets than existing methods. Moreover, the use of a
		  model selection framework to simultaneously compare a
		  variety of hy- potheses advances our ability to assess
		  alternative evolutionary explanations.},
